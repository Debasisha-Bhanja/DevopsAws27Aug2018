Route Tables
=============
A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.
Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table; the table controls the routing for the subnet.
A subnet can only be associated with one route table at a time, but you can associate multiple subnets with the same route table.

Route Table Basics
===================
The following are the basic things that you need to know about route tables:

Your VPC has an implicit router.

Your VPC automatically comes with a main route table that you can modify.

You can create additional custom route tables for your VPC.

Each subnet must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for the subnet. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a particular route table, the subnet is implicitly associated with the main route table.

You cannot delete the main route table, but you can replace the main route table with a custom table that you've created (so that this table is the default table each new subnet is associated with).

Each route in a table specifies a destination CIDR and a target (for example, traffic destined for the external corporate network 172.16.0.0/12 is targeted for the virtual private gateway). We use the most specific route that matches the traffic to determine how to route the traffic.

CIDR blocks for IPv4 and IPv6 are treated separately. For example, a route with a destination CIDR of 0.0.0.0/0 (all IPv4 addresses) does not automatically include all IPv6 addresses. You must create a route with a destination CIDR of ::/0 for all IPv6 addresses.


VPC LIMITS
==========
VPCs per region=== 5

The limit for internet gateways per region is directly correlated to this one. Increasing this limit increases the limit on internet gateways per region by the same amount.

The number of VPCs in the region multiplied by the number of security groups per VPC cannot exceed 10000.

Subnets per VPC==>200

IPv4 CIDR blocks per VPC==>5	This limit is made up of your primary CIDR block plus 4 secondary CIDR blocks.
IPv6 CIDR blocks per VPC==>1 This limit cannot be increased.
